# User Story: Technical Interview Exercise

## As a user
I want to deploy a API with access from outside and prevent the connection to the database outside.
So that I can demonstrate the deployment process using Azure Kubernetes Service, Terraform, and Helm.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The API should be accessible from the internet.
- The database should be configured for optimal performance and not be directly accessible from the internet.
- The infrastructure should be managed using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform).
- The deployment should be automated using CI/CD pipeline.
- The system should have monitoring, logging, and alerting in place.
